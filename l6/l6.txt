Question 2a: What is the systemctl command to show whether bind9 is running or not?
Ans: 
    systemctl status bind9

Question 2b: Why does the dig command (dig ocf.berkeley.edu) work if @localhost is not present at the end (if bind9 is not started) but times out when @localhost is added?
Ans:
    if @localhost is not present at the end (if bind9 is not started) then dig looks for nameservers in /etc/resolv.conf where actual DNS you use for surfing are placed. If @localhost is added, dig uses localhost that is user machine for DNS but we don't have a DNS setup on our machine before bind9.

Question 2d: What commands did you use to make requests to the local DNS server for your additional entries?

    dig alias.example.com @localhost
