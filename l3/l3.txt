Exercise 2: Trouble shooting 
    Solution:
    1) gcc -o ocfdocs ocfdocs.c
    2) mkdir -p packocfdocs/usr/bin
    3) mv ocfdocs packocfdocs/usr/bin
    4) fpm -s dir -t deb -n ocfdocs -v 1.0~ocf1 -C packocfdocs
    5) sudo dpkg -i ocfdocs_1.0~ocf1_amd64.deb
    6) ocfdocs
    7) sudo dpkg -i ocfspy_1.0~ocf1_amd64.deb
    8) ocfspy

Compiling and packaging Questions:
1) No
2) Because executables in packaged "/usr/bin" are transferred into global "/usr/bin" which allows them to be run while being in any pwd (present working directory). 

Debugging
1) ocfdocs
2) Sinkhole

Exercise 3: Spelunking 
1) tree
2) libc6 (>= 2.38) -- in control file
3) Additional folders like /usr/lib and /usr/include are not needed for this package because it doesn't need header files and other libraries in its codebase.
4) None
